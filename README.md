Description of Problem Domain:
The problem domains our team is looking to explore are the Time Management and Notetaking domains.

Higher Level Description of Application Type:
Our team is looking to develop a software version of the productivity system referred to in the book, Getting Things Done by David Allen. This system involves creating an initial list of items/thoughts that need to be addressed. You then clarify each item into Reference, Delayed, or Actionable.

Actionable Items are to-do tasks that are given a due date and an optional description.

An idea that cannot be prioritized immediately is categorized as "Delayed" and put the Delayed section.
If it is something that will need referencing for later, it is put into the References section.

API
We will be using the Google Keep API to create Reference and Delayed items. 
We hope to use the Google Calendar API to synchronize actionable events with the userâ€™s calendar.
